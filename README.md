An Arduino with a keyboard library, that attempts to run powershell through keyboard shortcuts over USB. A microSD card board for 'hot swap' powershell payloads. A Pycom as a Wi-Fi AP to receive commands for the Arduino from an ESP32 (currently Adafruit HUZZAH32) with a "FeatherWing" Oled screen that has 3 buttons to initiate payloads.
